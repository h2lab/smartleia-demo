    "# LEIA-Solo Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you will get the essentials to know in order to get your  first steps with your LEIA Solo Board.\n",
    "Details about the hardware, software and firmware are documented [here](https://h2lab.github.io/smartleia.github.io/quickstart.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firmware\n",
    "\n",
    "The firmware API is fully specified [here](https://h2lab.github.io/smartleia.github.io/c/test.html) and can be accessed using the python library of the smartleia library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This library is packaged for Debian (see https://h2lab.github.io/smartleia.github.io/installation.html) and can be installed using pip.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Software\n",
    "\n",
    "The smartleia library expose an efficient smartcard oriented interface in order to communicate with the target.\n",
    "This interface is fully documented [here](https://h2lab.github.io/smartleia.github.io/api.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't hesitate to take a look to the overall [LEIA-Solo documentation and tooling informations](https://h2lab.github.io/smartleia.github.io/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "Smart card interface and signal acquisition Side-channel attacks are divided into two phases: signal acquisition and signal statistical analysis. The quality of the acquisition of side-channel\n",
    "signal is essential to get proper results during the analysis phase. \n",
    "This is why the acquisition circuitry has been designed with great care.\n",
    "\n",
    "On LEIA the leakage signal used for the side channel signals\n",
    "capture is the power consumption in the form of current sensing on the\n",
    "power lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Board pinout\n",
    "\n",
    "![LEIA Solo Pinout](https://h2lab.org/images/devices/leia_pinout.png \"LEIA Pinout\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing points\n",
    "\n",
    "![LEIA Solo test points TOP](https://h2lab.org/images/devices/leia_test_points_top.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![LEIA Solo test points BOT](https://h2lab.org/images/devices/leia_test_points_bot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current sense\n",
    "When sensing current, the designer can choose to place\n",
    "the sensors (usually a serial resistor on the power line) either between the\n",
    "supply voltage (VCC) and load, or between the load and ground. The\n",
    "former is called high-side sensing whereas the latter is called low-side\n",
    "sensing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High-side sensing** has the advantage that the load is directly connected\n",
    "to the ground GND. In other words, there is no change on the load side\n",
    "except a small power drop due to the current sensor on the VCC line.\n",
    "Nevertheless the main disadvantage is that we have to use a differential\n",
    "probe to measure the current. \n",
    "* In **low-side sensing** the current is sensed in\n",
    "the ground return path (GND) of the power line to the monitored load.\n",
    "This has the advantage to produce a ground referenced measured signal\n",
    "but the load is no more directly connected to GND.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our design the target, the LEIA boards and the controling device like the Chipwhisperer can have **separate power domains**, since we do not want the noise produced by the power switching supply the controling device to be visible in the measurements. **We choose to use a low-side measurement** as it minimizes the amount of hardware to support all the power domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shunt Resistor\n",
    "The shunt resistor is the element that is used in a\n",
    "circuit to redirect currents around the measuring device. The addition of\n",
    "a shunt resistor induces a voltage drop at the maximum current rating.\n",
    "This is why the value of the Shunt Resistor must be selected carefully.\n",
    "Important parameters include the resistance tolerance, the power rating\n",
    "and the temperature coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The power rating indicates the amount of electrical power that\n",
    "the resistor can dissipate at a given ambient temperature without\n",
    "being damaged nor changing the resistor parameters.\n",
    " * The temperature coefficient describes the relative change of resistor\n",
    "value according to the temperature.\n",
    " * Resistance tolerance is the accuracy the constructor guarantees on\n",
    "the component’s characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "ISO7816 Class A devices, which are the most power-consuming devices\n",
    "among smart cards, can draw at most 160 mA for 400 ns and continuously\n",
    "draw at most 60 mA. We want the voltage drop at maximum current to be\n",
    "at most 50 mV for not disturbing nominal working of the TOE whatever\n",
    "class tho TOE belongs to. \n",
    "Thus we decided to use a **0.1 Ω resistor** with\n",
    "a tolerance of 1%, a temperature coefficient of 300 PPM/C and a power\n",
    "rating of 100 mW. It is a widespread, easily available component that\n",
    "meets the needs. This resistor, as it induces a maximum voltage drop far\n",
    "from the limit, allows us to get clean measurements.\n",
    "Connectors and measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "![LEIA Solo shunt circuit](https://h2lab.org/images/devices/leia_shunt_circuit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurements bandwidth\n",
    "In order to provide high quality measurements, we use SMA End Launch Connectors since they offer reliable broadband performance from DC to 18 GHz with low reflection and constant 50 Ω impedance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Because we want you to be able to measure the leaking signal from the target without any bandwidth loss we have chosen to not embed a low noise-amplifier.** This allow you to caracterise the leaking signal of your target and decide which amplifier to use to get the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up measure Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to setup LEIA in the measure mode: \n",
    "\n",
    " * Move the PRG1, PRG2, PRG3 (LEIA Solo < v1.4) and PRG4 to the LEIA position (1-2).\n",
    " * Remove the shunt bypass jumber if it is set.\n",
    " * Move the tearing jumper to the OFF position.\n",
    " * Setup the power source for the smartcard. We would advise an external \"clean\" power source for clean measurements. However, we are able to get proper traces with the USB-C power supply on the funcard. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Trace Acquisition using cheap scope\n",
    "\n",
    "![LEIA Solo Testing with cheak scope](https://h2lab.org/images/devices/leia_traces_cheap_scope.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing setup : \n",
    "\n",
    " * Trigger is set on EXT and connected to C8 which is configured in trigger mode 2 (Rising Slope 1V).\n",
    " * C4 configured in trigger mode 1 is set on CH1. The signal is toggling at every AES round (1V/DIV).\n",
    " * The Shunt signal is connected on CH2 (20mV/DIV). \n",
    " * The sampling rate is set to 500MS/s with a 500us/div scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up Funcard programming mode\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to setup LEIA in the Funcard programming mode: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Move the PRG1, PRG2, PRG3 (LEIA Solo < v1.4) and PRG4 to the ISP position (2-3).\n",
    "* Setup the shunt bypass jumber if not set.\n",
    "* Move the tearing jumper to the OFF position.\n",
    "* Setup the power source for the smartcard to enable the USB-C power supply on the funcard. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regulatory compliance & handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The LEA board is intended for use as a development measure platform. The board is an open system design, which does not include a\n",
    "shielded enclosure. This may cause interference to other electrical or\n",
    "electronic devices in close proximity. In a domestic environment, this product\n",
    "may cause radio interference in which case the user may be required to take\n",
    "adequate measures. In addition, this board should not be used near any medical\n",
    "equipment or RF devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board is sensitive to ESD. Hold the board only by its edges. After removing the board from its box, place it on a grounded, static-free surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The board can become hot, like any fan-less design, during continuous high CPU loads, mind its temperature while handling it.\n",
